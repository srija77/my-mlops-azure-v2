# Energy Market Forecasting — MLOps on Microsoft Azure

An **Azure ML-native** re-implementation of the local energy-market forecasting
MLOps pipeline, running on the **same March 2025 data**. Same modelling logic
(5 forecasters, best-by-RMSE, champion promotion), re-platformed from the
local/GCP-style stack (DVC + local MLflow + Feast/SQLite + Flask on minikube +
Prometheus/Grafana + GitHub Actions/ArgoCD) onto managed Azure services.

## Service mapping (what replaced what)

| Concern | Source project | This Azure project |
|---|---|---|
| Pipeline orchestration | DVC (`dvc.yaml`, `dvc repro`) | **Azure ML Pipeline** (`aml/pipeline.yml`, component per stage) |
| Experiment tracking | Local MLflow server (`:5000`) | **Azure ML built-in MLflow** (workspace tracking URI) |
| Model registry | MLflow registry + `champion` alias | **Azure ML Model Registry** + `champion=true` tag (AML has no alias API) |
| Data versioning | DVC + S3 remote | **Azure ML Data Assets** (versioned, Blob-backed) |
| Feature store | Feast (SQLite registry + online) | **None** — features are a versioned Azure ML **Data Asset** (`march_2025_features`). See docs/module_05_features.md for why, and what AML Managed Feature Store would require |
| Serving | Flask + gunicorn on minikube | **Azure ML Managed Online Endpoint** (`scoring/score.py`) |
| Container registry | GHCR | **Azure Container Registry** (created by Bicep) |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions + ArgoCD | **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/mlops.yml`) — ci → train → deploy (approval gate) → monitor |
| Monitoring / drift | Prometheus + Grafana + Evidently | **Azure ML Model Monitoring** + Application Insights |
| Infra | docker-compose / k8s manifests | **Bicep** (`infra/main.bicep`) |

See **[docs/DEMO_GUIDE.md](docs/DEMO_GUIDE.md)** to run the demo end to end, [docs/](docs/) for the doc index, and [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full mapping and data flow.

## Pipeline stages (unchanged logic)

```
energy_raw (bronze Data Asset)
        │
        ▼  prepare_features   → Feast-style features parquet
        ▼  train              → 5 models, best→AML Model Registry, MLflow runs
        ▼  evaluate  (gate)   → holdout RMSE/MAPE, tag version passed_eval
        ▼  promote            → champion=true tag if it beats production
        ▼  deploy (CD)        → Managed Online Endpoint serves the champion
```

## The inference layer

The managed online endpoint is a keyed HTTPS route speaking a 37-column tabular
contract — correct for machines, unusable for people. `app/` is the layer in
front of it: a grouped operator form, a JSON API, and split liveness/readiness
probes, shipped as a container to Azure Container Apps. The endpoint key is
resolved from Key Vault at revision start via managed identity, so it exists in
neither the image nor the template.

```bash
docker compose up --build     # local, against the live endpoint (see .env.example)
```

## Quickstart

Full step-by-step — including the portal click paths — is in **[docs/DEMO_GUIDE.md](docs/DEMO_GUIDE.md)**. The short version:

```bash
az login

# 1. Provision infrastructure
./infra/deploy.sh rg-energy-mlops eastus         # or infra/deploy.ps1 on Windows

# 2. Point config/config.yaml at the created workspace/ACR (names printed above)

# 3. Register AML assets and run the training pipeline
az extension add -n ml -y
az configure --defaults group=rg-energy-mlops workspace=mlw-energy-forecast
az ml environment create -f aml/environment/train-env.yml
az ml compute create      -f aml/compute.yml
az ml data create         -f aml/data_asset.yml
az ml job create          -f aml/pipeline.yml

# 4. Deploy the champion to a real-time endpoint
az ml online-endpoint   create -f aml/endpoints/endpoint.yml
az ml online-deployment create -f aml/endpoints/deployment.yml \
    --set model=azureml:dam_mcp_forecast:$VER --all-traffic   # $VER from the champion=true tag

# 5. Predict
az ml online-endpoint invoke -n dam-mcp-endpoint --request-file scoring/sample_request.json
```

## Run the tests locally

```bash
pip install -r environment/requirements.txt pytest ruff
pytest tests/ -q
```
